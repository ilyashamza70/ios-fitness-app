### Next Steps

1. **Complete the macOS Ventura setup on VirtualBox and install Xcode**.
2. **Create the initial project in Xcode and set up GitHub repository**.
3. **Start with the core functionality: exercise selection and input fields**.
4. **Document the progress and updates in Confluence**.

Once you have the macOS environment set up and Xcode installed, we can proceed to coding the initial features and integrating HealthKit.
